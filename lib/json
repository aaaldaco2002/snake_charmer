    "Information": "This snake looks and feels like rubber, hence its name. It is a small, shiny, stout snake (12 to 28 inches) with very small eyes and a blunt tail. The scales are small and smooth, except for those on the head, which are enlarged. Dorsum of adult is plain brown to olive green, venter is cream to yellow, sometimes with dark flecks or brown, orange, or black mottling; young are pinkish to tan above, light yellow to pink below. Top of head is covered with large symmetrical plates; pupil is vertically oval. Males and some females have a spur on each side in the anal region. Total length of adults usually is 35 to 83 cm (Stebbins 1985).",
    "What to do if Bitten": "Rubber boas are known to never strike at or bite a human under any circumstances but will release a potent musk from their vent if they feel threatened.",

    "Information": "A small snake, the rosy boa normally attains a total length (including tail) of 17–34 in (43–86 cm), although some coastal specimens from California reach 36–44 in (91–112 cm). A large adult has a body width about the diameter of a golf ball. Coloration of the rosy boa is highly variable, and usually locale-specific. The common name is derived from the rosy or salmon coloration that is common on the belly of specimens of the rosy boa originating from coastal southern California and Baja Mexico. Most rosy boa specimens do not have this ventral coloration, but instead have a series of dark to orange spots on a light-colored background. Almost all specimens of the rosy boa have at least some trace of three longitudinal stripes, one down the center of the back, and two on the lower sides. The appearance of these stripes varies widely, from extremely straight and having high contrast with the interspaces, to extremely broken with almost no contrast with the interspaces. Stripe colors can be orange, maroon, rust, brown, or black. Interspace colors can be shades of light to dark gray, yellow, or tan.",
    "What to do if Bitten": "The species is not prone to bite in defense, but rather will release a foul-smelling musk from the base of the tail when threatened. When human bites have occurred, they have usually been the result of a feeding response with a captive animal. The rosy boa is nonvenomous. Its extreme docility, few needs, and attractive coloration have made the rosy boa popular with herpetoculturists.",

    "What to do if Bitten": "Some will strike and bite (particularly males), but most Glossy Snakes are quite gentle.",

    "Information": "A small (up to 369 mm or 15\" in total length) snake with more than 20 dark brown to black bands on a cream to light yellow background. Some subspecies have secondary orange saddles between the black bands (see subspecies descriptions below). The orange saddles are separated from the black by a margin of cream to light yellow background color. The posterior black bands usually completely encircle the body but the anterior bands do not. The snout is cream or light yellow. A black mask crosses the top of the head and covers the eyes. The underside is cream. With its countersunk jaw, valves in the nasal passages, concaved belly, and relatively flat snout, this snake is well equipped for burrowing under fine sand and loose gravel. The pupils are round and the scales are smooth and shiny. The Western Shovel-nosed Snake's light snout distinguishes it from the similar looking Sonoran Coralsnake which has a black snout. The similar Sonoran Shovel-nosed Snake has fewer than 21 black body bands.",
    "What to do if Bitten": "In a subsequent encounter, short bouts (less than 30 seconds) of biting and entwining occurred. One male was also observed to vibrate its tail when the other approached.",

    "Information": "The eastern racers are fast-moving, highly active, diurnal snakes. Their diet consists primarily of small rodents, frogs, toads, lizards, and other snakes.[7] Some subspecies are known to climb trees to eat eggs and young birds. Juveniles often consume soft-bodied insects, such as crickets and moths[citation needed]. Despite their specific name, constrictor, they do not really employ constriction, instead simply subduing struggling prey by pinning it bodily, pressing one or two coils against it to hold it in place instead of actually suffocating it. Most smaller prey items are simply swallowed alive.",
    "What to do if Bitten": "Both adults and juveniles are nervous, active snakes and usually bite immediately when handled. The bite is harmless. ",
