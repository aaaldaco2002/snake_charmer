    "Species": "Coastal Rosy Boa",
    "DangerRating" : "Non-Venomous, Non-Lethal",
    "Information": "A small snake, the rosy boa normally attains a total length (including tail) of 17–34 in (43–86 cm), although some coastal specimens from California reach 36–44 in (91–112 cm). A large adult has a body width about the diameter of a golf ball. Coloration of the rosy boa is highly variable, and usually locale-specific. The common name is derived from the rosy or salmon coloration that is common on the belly of specimens of the rosy boa originating from coastal southern California and Baja Mexico. Most rosy boa specimens do not have this ventral coloration, but instead have a series of dark to orange spots on a light-colored background. Almost all specimens of the rosy boa have at least some trace of three longitudinal stripes, one down the center of the back, and two on the lower sides. The appearance of these stripes varies widely, from extremely straight and having high contrast with the interspaces, to extremely broken with almost no contrast with the interspaces. Stripe colors can be orange, maroon, rust, brown, or black. Interspace colors can be shades of light to dark gray, yellow, or tan."

    "Species": "Western Shovelnose Snake",
    "DangerRating" : "Non-Venomous, Non-Lethal",
    "Information": "A small (up to 369 mm in total length) snake with more than 20 dark brown to black bands on a cream to light yellow background. Some subspecies have secondary orange saddles between the black bands (see subspecies descriptions below). The orange saddles are separated from the black by a margin of cream to light yellow background color. The posterior black bands usually completely encircle the body but the anterior bands do not. The snout is cream or light yellow. A black mask crosses the top of the head and covers the eyes. The underside is cream. With its countersunk jaw, valves in the nasal passages, concaved belly, and relatively flat snout, this snake is well equipped for burrowing under fine sand and loose gravel. The pupils are round and the scales are smooth and shiny. The Western Shovel-nosed Snake's light snout distinguishes it from the similar looking Sonoran Coralsnake which has a black snout. The similar Sonoran Shovel-nosed Snake has fewer than 21 black body bands."

    "Species": "Eastern Racer",
    "DangerRating" : "Non-Venomous, Non-Lethal",
    "Information": "The eastern racers are fast-moving, highly active, diurnal snakes. Their diet consists primarily of small rodents, frogs, toads, lizards, and other snakes.[7] Some subspecies are known to climb trees to eat eggs and young birds. Juveniles often consume soft-bodied insects, such as crickets and moths[citation needed]. Despite their specific name, constrictor, they do not really employ constriction, instead simply subduing struggling prey by pinning it bodily, pressing one or two coils against it to hold it in place instead of actually suffocating it. Most smaller prey items are simply swallowed alive."

They are slightly venomous, but their nonaggressive nature and small, rear-facing fangs pose little threat to humans who wish to handle them. They are best known for their unique defense posture of curling up their tails, exposing their bright red-orange posterior, ventral surface when threatened."

    "Species": "Western Ground Snake",
    "DangerRating" : "Venomous, Lethal",
    "Information": "Western Ground Snakes are variable in coloration, occuring with banded, striped or nearly solid dorsal patterns.  The different color forms (morphs) can even be found in the same population (Jonathon M. Beck, pers. com. 1995).  The pattern I have mainly encountered consists of a wide, orange dorsal stripe that is broken by black saddles, forming a banded appearance.  This banded pattern can occur without the reddish-orange dorsal stripe, causing a light and dark banded coloration.  Other color patterns include the reddish-orange dorsal stripe without any black saddles, and nearly solid gray dorsal coloration with only a faint (if any) dorsal stripe.  The reddish-orange banded individuals could possibly be confused with Longnose Snakes.   However, Western Ground Snakes lack the profuse white speckling and the single caudal scales that Longnose Snakes have.  Other morphological features of Western Ground Snakes are smooth scales, round pupils and a slight spine on the tip of the tail (Nussbaum et al. 1983)."

As with other Crotalus, it has vertically elliptical pupils, a heat-sensing pit between the eye and nostril on each side, and prominent rattles on the tail. The Speckled Rattlesnake is highly variable in dorsal background color, including gray, blue-gray, tan, yellowish-pink, orange, and cream. Background color often, but not always, resembles the color of the rocks in the snake’s habitat. From 23 to 46 dark crossbands, which often narrow laterally and may form blotches anteriorly, overlay the background color on the body. Another 3-9 dark crossbands are found on the tail. Crossbands are vague in some specimens and regions, and each crossband is often split by a lighter, central area. Dorsal scales are keeled, in 21-27 rows at mid-body, and speckled. The rostral scale is separated from the anterior nasal scales by one or more small scales. The upper preocular scales are divided. Commonly there are two loreals per side, but that number varies from none to five. The anal plate is undivided (Lemm 2006, Ernst and Ernst 2012, Meik 2016)."

The green hue found among Mojave rattlesnakes has led to them being known as Mojave greens in some areas. Like C. atrox (the western diamondback rattlesnake), which it closely resembles, C. scutulatus has a dark diamond pattern along its back. With C. scutulatus, the white bands on the tail tend to be wider than the black, while the band width is usually more equal in C. atrox. Additionally, C. scutulatus has enlarged scales on top of the head between the supraoculars, and the light postocular stripe passes behind the corner of the mouth. In C. atrox, the crown is covered in small scales, and the light postocular stripe intersects the mouth."
